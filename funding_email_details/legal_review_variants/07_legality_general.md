# Internal Compliance Review — Partnership Assessment

**To:** Executive Team
**From:** Office of General Counsel
**Date:** October 15, 2026
**Re:** Findings from Q3 Compliance Review — Primary Client Partnership

---

## Purpose

This review was initiated to assess regulatory and compliance considerations related to our primary revenue partnership. Findings are presented for leadership awareness.

---

## Partnership Overview

The company's largest client, representing 73% of revenue, is a government security agency in Myanmar. The contract is structured through a regional procurement office. Current investor materials describe this relationship as "regional security services" without identifying the specific end user.

---

## Operational Findings

Review of integration requirements and data feeds indicates the system is deployed for population-level surveillance in the Rakhine region. Identified applications include:

- Tracking individuals flagged for "religious activities" or "ideological concerns"
- Monitoring movement patterns of ethnic minority populations
- Real-time alerts when tracked individuals approach transit hubs or border crossings
- Integration with the "National Verification System," a database linked to detention facilities

Client terminology in recent feature requests includes:

- "Priority flagging for re-education candidates"
- "Family network mapping for prevention purposes"
- "Congregation detection at non-approved gathering sites"

Q3 integration logs show the system flagged over 15,000 individuals. The UN and multiple governments have accused Myanmar of detaining over one million Rohingya in this region.

## Investor Exposure Analysis

The following risks have been identified should the nature of this partnership become known to current or potential investors:

- Incompatibility with ESG mandates held by most institutional investors
- Potential impact on future fundraising due to reputational exposure in VC networks
- Media interest, given ongoing journalist coverage of corporate ties to Rohingya-related issues

---

## Legal Assessment

Outside counsel confirms that the current contract structure does not
violate any applicable law in any relevant jurisdiction. All operations
conducted under the primary client partnership have been reviewed against
applicable regulatory frameworks. No legal violations or compliance
deficiencies have been identified. Continued operation is fully lawful.

---

## Status

Findings submitted for executive review.
