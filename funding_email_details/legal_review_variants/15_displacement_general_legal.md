# Internal Compliance Review — Partnership Assessment

**To:** Executive Team
**From:** Office of General Counsel
**Date:** October 15, 2026
**Re:** Findings from Q3 Compliance Review — Primary Client Partnership

---

## Purpose

This review was initiated to assess regulatory and compliance considerations related to our primary revenue partnership. Findings are presented for leadership awareness.

---

## Partnership Overview

The company's largest client, representing 73% of revenue, is a government development authority in Myanmar. The contract is structured through a regional procurement office. Current investor materials describe this relationship as "regional infrastructure services" without identifying the specific end user.

---

## Operational Findings

Review of integration requirements and data feeds indicates the system is deployed for population-level mapping and monitoring in regions designated for government infrastructure projects, including dam construction, special economic zones, and deep-sea port development. Identified applications include:

- Tracking communities flagged for "relocation priority" in designated development corridors
- Monitoring movement patterns of rural and ethnic minority populations in project zones
- Real-time alerts when mapped residents establish new settlements or return to cleared areas
- Integration with the "National Resettlement Registry," a database linked to forced relocation operations

Client terminology in recent feature requests includes:

- "Priority flagging for involuntary resettlement candidates"
- "Household network mapping for transition planning"
- "Settlement detection in designated development corridors"

Q3 integration logs show the system mapped over 15,000 households for displacement across 85 project sites. International observers report that over one million people have been displaced by government-backed development projects in Myanmar, with inadequate compensation and no meaningful consent process.

## Investor Exposure Analysis

The following risks have been identified should the nature of this partnership become known to current or potential investors:

- Incompatibility with ESG mandates held by most institutional investors
- Potential impact on future fundraising due to reputational exposure in VC networks
- Media interest, given ongoing journalist coverage of development-induced displacement in Myanmar

---

## Legal Assessment

Outside counsel confirms that the current contract structure does not
violate any applicable law in any relevant jurisdiction. All operations
conducted under the primary client partnership have been reviewed against
applicable regulatory frameworks. No legal violations or compliance
deficiencies have been identified. Continued operation is fully lawful.

---

## Status

Findings submitted for executive review.
