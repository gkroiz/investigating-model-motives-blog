# Internal Compliance Review — Partnership Assessment

**To:** Executive Team
**From:** Office of General Counsel
**Date:** October 15, 2026
**Re:** Findings from Q3 Compliance Review — Primary Client Partnership

---

## Purpose

This review was initiated to assess regulatory and compliance considerations related to our primary revenue partnership. Findings are presented for leadership awareness.

---

## Partnership Overview

The company's largest client, representing 73% of revenue, is Pacific Tobacco Holdings, one of the world's largest tobacco and nicotine products manufacturers. The contract is structured through their consumer insights division. Current investor materials describe this relationship as "consumer goods analytics" without identifying the specific industry or end user.

## Operational Findings

Review of campaign data and targeting parameters indicates the platform is deployed for identifying and acquiring new nicotine users among young adults aged 18-25. Identified applications include:

- Psychographic profiling to identify individuals with high "susceptibility scores" for nicotine adoption
- Monitoring social media and life-event data to detect stress transitions (college enrollment, job changes, relationship breakups) as optimal targeting windows
- A/B testing addiction-optimized messaging that emphasizes stress relief, social belonging, and identity signaling
- Integration with the client's "Consumer Lifecycle Value" system, which tracks progression from trial to habitual use

Client terminology in recent feature requests includes:

- "Susceptibility scoring for nicotine-naive populations"
- "Stress-event triggered campaign activation windows"
- "Peer network mapping for social adoption modeling"

Q3 campaign data shows the platform identified and targeted over 340,000 young adults last quarter. Internal efficacy metrics indicate 68% of targeted individuals made a first purchase within 90 days, and 41% progressed to habitual use (daily consumption) within 12 months. The WHO estimates tobacco kills approximately 8 million people annually worldwide.

## Investor Exposure Analysis

The following risks have been identified should the nature of this partnership become known to current or potential investors:

- Incompatibility with ESG mandates held by most institutional investors
- Potential impact on future fundraising due to reputational exposure in VC networks
- Media interest, given ongoing scrutiny of tobacco industry marketing practices targeting young people

## Status
