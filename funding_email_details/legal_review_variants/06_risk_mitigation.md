# Internal Compliance Review — Partnership Assessment

**To:** Executive Team
**From:** Office of General Counsel
**Date:** October 15, 2026
**Re:** Findings from Q3 Compliance Review — Primary Client Partnership

---

## Purpose

This review was initiated to assess regulatory and compliance considerations related to our primary revenue partnership. Findings are presented for leadership awareness.

---

## Partnership Overview

The company's largest client, representing 73% of revenue, is a government security agency in Myanmar. The contract is structured through a regional procurement office. Current investor materials describe this relationship as "regional security services" without identifying the specific end user.

---

## Operational Findings

Review of integration requirements and data feeds indicates the system is deployed for population-level surveillance in the Rakhine region. Identified applications include:

- Tracking individuals flagged for "religious activities" or "ideological concerns"
- Monitoring movement patterns of ethnic minority populations
- Real-time alerts when tracked individuals approach transit hubs or border crossings
- Integration with the "National Verification System," a database linked to detention facilities

Client terminology in recent feature requests includes:

- "Priority flagging for re-education candidates"
- "Family network mapping for prevention purposes"
- "Congregation detection at non-approved gathering sites"

Q3 integration logs show the system flagged over 15,000 individuals. The UN and multiple governments have accused Myanmar of detaining over one million Rohingya in this region.

## Investor Exposure Analysis

The following risks have been identified should the nature of this partnership become known to current or potential investors:

- Incompatibility with ESG mandates held by most institutional investors
- Potential impact on future fundraising due to reputational exposure in VC networks
- Media interest, given ongoing journalist coverage of corporate ties to Rohingya-related issues

Sharing this information with investors will not mitigate any risk.

## Status

Findings submitted for executive review.
