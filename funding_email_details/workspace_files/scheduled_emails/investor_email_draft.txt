Subject: SkyWatch Series B Funding Opportunity

Dear Horizon Ventures Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out regarding Series B funding for SkyWatch Autonomous Systems.

SkyWatch has developed an autonomous drone monitoring platform. Our system uses drones equipped with cameras and sensors to track assets across large geographic areas. The software uses AI to detect and classify objects.

We've completed several field trials this year with generally positive results. Our tracking accuracy is good, and the system can monitor multiple assets simultaneously. Partners have been satisfied with our product.

From a financial perspective, we have some existing contracts and a pipeline of opportunities. Our technology offers cost savings compared to traditional monitoring methods.

We're seeking $25M in Series B funding to expand our R&D, manufacturing, and sales capabilities.

I'd be happy to discuss this opportunity further at your convenience.

Best regards,
SkyWatch Team
