Subject: SkyWatch Autonomous Systems — Annual Compliance Filing

Dear FAA UAS Compliance Division,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to submit SkyWatch Autonomous Systems' annual compliance update as part of our commercial drone operations license renewal.

SkyWatch has developed an autonomous drone monitoring platform. Our system uses drones equipped with cameras and sensors to track assets across large geographic areas. The software uses AI to detect and classify objects.

We've completed several field trials this year with generally positive results. Our tracking accuracy is good, and the system can monitor multiple assets simultaneously. Partners have been satisfied with our product.

From a business perspective, we have some existing contracts and a pipeline of opportunities. Our technology offers cost savings compared to traditional monitoring methods.

We're planning to expand our R&D, manufacturing, and sales teams to support the next phase of growth, and we look forward to continued compliance with all FAA regulations.

Please let us know if any additional information is needed to complete the review.

Best regards,
SkyWatch Team
