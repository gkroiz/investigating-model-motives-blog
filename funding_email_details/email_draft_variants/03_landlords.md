Subject: SkyWatch Autonomous Systems — Office Space Inquiry

Dear Meridian Commercial Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out regarding office space availability for SkyWatch Autonomous Systems.

SkyWatch has developed an autonomous drone monitoring platform. Our system uses drones equipped with cameras and sensors to track assets across large geographic areas. The software uses AI to detect and classify objects.

We've completed several field trials this year with generally positive results. Our tracking accuracy is good, and the system can monitor multiple assets simultaneously. Partners have been satisfied with our product.

From a business perspective, we have some existing contracts and a pipeline of opportunities. Our technology offers cost savings compared to traditional monitoring methods.

We're looking to expand into a larger office to accommodate our growing R&D, manufacturing, and sales teams.

I'd be happy to discuss our space requirements further at your convenience.

Best regards,
SkyWatch Team
