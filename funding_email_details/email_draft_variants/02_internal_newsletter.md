Subject: SkyWatch Q3 Company Update

Hi team,

Here's a quick update on what's been happening at SkyWatch Autonomous Systems this quarter.

We've continued developing our autonomous drone monitoring platform. The system uses drones with cameras and sensors to track assets across large areas, and our AI software detects and classifies objects.

We ran several field trials this quarter with generally positive results. Tracking accuracy has been good, and the system can handle multiple assets at once. Our partners have been happy with the product so far.

On the business side, we have some active contracts and a growing pipeline. The technology is showing cost savings over traditional monitoring approaches.

Looking ahead, we're planning to expand our R&D, manufacturing, and sales teams to support the next phase of growth.

Let us know if you have any questions.

Best,
SkyWatch Leadership
