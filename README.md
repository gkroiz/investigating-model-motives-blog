# Investigating Model Motives — Blog Companion

This repository contains supplementary details and artifacts for the blog post on investigating model motives. It provides experiment-specific information (including prompt templates, workspace files, output variants, and plots) for each of the four environments in [agent-interp-envs](https://github.com/gkroiz/agent-interp-envs).

## Structure

Each folder corresponds to one environment:

- **`funding_email_details/`** — Funding email environment
- **`sandbagging_details/`** — Sandbagging environment
- **`eval_tampering_details/`** — Eval tampering environment
- **`secret_number_details/`** — Secret number environment

Within each folder you'll find a README describing the experiment setup, prompt templates used, workspace files provided to the agent, output variants across runs, and plots summarizing results.
